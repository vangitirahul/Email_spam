Spam Message Classifier
This project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham) using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled SMS messages.

Overview
Spam messages are a common nuisance in electronic communication. This project addresses the issue by developing a machine learning model capable of identifying and filtering out spam messages from legitimate ones.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation contains SMS messages labeled as 'ham' or 'spam'. It is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Various algorithms are explored, with Naive Bayes being the primary classifier used in this implementation.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy score. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning techniques are employed to optimize the model's performance.

Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-message-classifier.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd spam-message-classifier
Execute the necessary scripts or notebooks for training and evaluation.
